# andtickety
andtyckety is an open-source ticketing project designed for static destinations (e.g., museums, zoos, bus rides, aquariums, planetariums, art galleries, science centers, theme parks, botanical gardens, historical sites, observatories, guided tours, escape rooms, spa/wellness centers, and amusement arcades/fun centers).  Users can browse different ticket categories, securely purchase tickets via Stripe, and receive a QR code along with a link to the QR code via email for easy access.  This project focuses on making ticketing simple, fast, and convenient for both users and destination operators.
